This engine hasn't been started yet, there will still be some time until the team starts working on it (And by the team I mean me and my good friend WayWay)

If you would like to suggest, show/advertise or ask something, USE DISCUSSIONS FOR THAT!

And If you would like to join the team, go to the "Request to join the team" category with what you are good at and the team and Springy (The lead dev) will decide if you are worthy enough to join

Have an amazing day, and stay safe, everyone!
